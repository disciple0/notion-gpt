## <u>Two steps to see the magic (with Notion X OpenAI)</u>!

### Step 1: Notion Setup
Create an account on [Notion](https://notion.so) or log in if you already have one.

#### 1.1 Generate private API keys to your Notion data
1. Go to [Notion's My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
2. Click `+ New Integration`.
3. Enter the integration name. (NotionGPT is a good choice)
4. Click on the integration you just created.
5. Visit the `Secrets` tab.
6. Copy the `Internal Integration Secret`. Add `Internal Integration Secret` against `NOTION_KEY` in the inputs section.

#### 1.2 Create a Notion page to talk with NotionGPT
1. Create a page "NotionGPT Assistant" where "NotionGPT" will store all the generated content.
2. Click on the `...` more menu in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Scroll down to connections and click `Connect to`.
4. Search for the integration you created, click it, and select `Confirm`.
5. Finally, get the `PAGE_ID` by clicking on `Share` followed by `copy link` (link would look something like `https://www.notion.so/NotionGPT-Assistant-<PAGE_ID>`). Add `PAGE_ID` against `NOTION_PAGE_ID` in the inputs section.

#### 1.3 Let NotionGPT select a cool cover to go along with your awesome plan (on Notion pages generated by NotionGPT)
1. Create an account on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/join) or log in if you already have one.
2. Go to [Unsplash's Applications page](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).
3. Click `New Application`.
4. Agree to all the terms and condtions and click `Accept terms`.
5. Fill in your application name and description. (NotionGPT is a good choice for both)
6. Click `Create application`.
7. Scroll down to keys and copy the `Access Key`. Add `Access Key` against `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in the inputs section.

### Step 2: OpenAI Setup
Create an account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or log in if you already have one.

#### 2.1 Get your API key
1. Go to the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). (Note that you may have to verify your phone number to do so)
2. Click `+ Create new secret key`. Give a name to the key, select the project & click on `Create secret key`. (NotionGPT is a good choice for both)
3. Copy the `Secret Key` - should look like `sk-proj-<ID_WITH_48_CHARACTERS>`. (Note: you won't be able to see it again). Add `Secret Key` against `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the inputs section.

#### 2.2 Finetuning the GPT model
1. Download `Fine-Tuning Data` using below button `Download Fine-Tuning Data` or [repository](https://huggingface.co/spaces/disciple0/notiongpt/tree/main/data).
2. Visit the [OpenAI Fine-tuning page](https://platform.openai.com/finetune) and click `+ Create` in the top right corner.
3. Fill in the form with the following information, and leave the rest as default:
- `Base Model`: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` (or any other model you prefer)
- `Training data`: Upload the `finetuning_data_cot_v7.jsonl` file.
- `Suffix`: NotionGPT (or any other name you prefer)
Note: If failed, try visiting the [Billings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to add a payment method for your OpenAI account. Then, click `Add to credit balance` to add some funds to your account, I recommend $10 to start.
4. Click `Create` and wait for the model to finish training.
5. Once the model is trained, copy the model name. (It should look something like `ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:personal:notiongpt:<ID>`). Add `model name` against `MODEL_NAME` in the inputs section.
